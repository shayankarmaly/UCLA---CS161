					Homework #4 Problems

1. The instance is unsatisfiable with 3 colors. 

2. Doing the conversion again, but this time with 4 colors, the instance is now satisfiable. 

3. The answers of these two SAT instances tell us about the graph coloring problem of the above graph that the SAT solver requires greater than or equal to 4 colors which explains why in (1) the color index of 3 is not satisfiable. A solution (a coloring) to the graph coloring problem of the above graph based on the results of RSat would be using the 4 colors (green, blue, yellow, purple):
Node 1 - green
Node 2 - blue
Node 3 - purple
Node 4 - green
Node 5 - blue
Node 6 - purple
Node 7 - yellow


4. Using a similar approach to solve the graph coloring of the graph described in graph2.txt, the minimum number of colors required to properly color this graph we would need would be 8 colors since it was unsatisfiable with colors less than 8, but satisfiable with 8 colors.
